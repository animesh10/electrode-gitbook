# What is Electrode?

> Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with a standardized structure that follows best practices and has modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability and simple deployment to multiple cloud providers—so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Core: Quick + Easy

Electrode Core allows you to build a flexible and universal React/Node.js application in minutes, with support for server-side rendering and easy deployment. Use Electrode to start new projects quickly with a simple, consistent structure that follows modern best practices.

The heart of the Electrode platform is managed by the [Electrode Archetype System](http://www.electrode.io/docs/what_are_archetypes.html), which allows for a standardized configuration, structure and workflow throughout the entire application. By enforcing a sensible structure and consistency for components, modules and the entire app, Electrode’s Archetype system helps you build scalable applications you can trust while ensuring streamlined development and deployment.

**It only takes a few minutes to get your new Electrode application running and deployed to the cloud. See our **[**Getting Started:Quick Guide**](http://www.electrode.io/docs/get_started.html) **to get started now.**
