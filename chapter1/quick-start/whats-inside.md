> &lt;your-awesome-app&gt;/src/client/components/home.jsx

This is the home React component for your app. [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. A simplified way to look at React is that it can be used as the _View_ in a Model-View-Controller application. It was created by Facebook and is being actively developed.

Building with React lets developers create a modular and reusable component architecture. We can then reuse the business logic in existing\_models\_and\_controllers\_because React components encapsulate only the\_view\_layer. The components you write are self-contained, which aids developers in quickly determining what a component does directly by reading the source. Finally, it is ideally suited to Universal JavaScript \(previously called Isomorphic JavaScript\), the practice of sharing code between the server and the client.
