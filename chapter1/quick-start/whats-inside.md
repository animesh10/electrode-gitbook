> &lt;your-awesome-app&gt;/src/client/components/home.jsx

This is the home React component for your app.[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. A simplified way to look at React is that it can be used as the_View_in a_Model-View-Controller_application. It was created by Facebook and is being actively developed.

Building with React lets developers create a modular and reusable component architecture. We can then reuse the business logic in existing_models_and_controllers_because React components encapsulate only the_view_layer. The components you write are self-contained, which aids developers in quickly determining what a component does directly by reading the source. Finally, it is ideally suited to Universal JavaScript \(previously called Isomorphic JavaScript\), the practice of sharing code between the server and the client.
